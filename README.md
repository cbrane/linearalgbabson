## How to Use

Each Jupyter notebook (`*.ipynb`) contains self-contained examples and problems. To run these notebooks:

1. Ensure you have Python and Jupyter installed.
2. Install required libraries: `pip install numpy scipy sympy`
3. Open the notebooks in Jupyter and run the cells to see the calculations and results.
