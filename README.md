## How to Use

Each Jupyter notebook (`*.ipynb`) contains self-contained examples and problems. To run these notebooks:

1. Ensure you have Python and Jupyter installed
2. Install required libraries: `pip install numpy scipy sympy matplotlib pandas`
3. Clone the repository
4. Open the notebooks in Jupyter and run the cells to see the calculations and results

The notebooks are organized by topic and increase in complexity throughout the course. Each notebook includes detailed explanations, code implementations, and visualizations where appropriate.
